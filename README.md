# map-marker-dx-test

The application contains a single view that allows users to specify their address.
The view has an input field for the address and a map that shows the address on a map.
Upon entering an address in the input field, the application does a geolocation lookup and updates the map marker to the new address.

Now the application should be developed further.
First, it should show a label on the address marker.
It should also allow users to modify the address by dragging the address marker on the map.

To start with the DX test, run the application:
- Either run the `Application` class from the IDE
- Or run `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux)

Then open the [task view](http://localhost:8080/task) in your browser.
You can also take a peek at the expected outcome of the task in the [solution view](http://localhost:8080/solution).

To get started with coding, open the `Task` view in your IDE.
